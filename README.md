**Introduction**<br>
During my internship at Qwince, I had the opportunity to work on this project. 
I will showcase here my code and analysis, however, to maintain the confidentiality of my research, I have chosen not to disclose the real subject and location.
For the purposes of this presentation, I'll be referring to my research as 

# <center>An Analysis on Blacksmith Business in the Game of Thrones Universe</center>
<br>

**Database description**<br>
My database tracked informations about invoice exchanges between blacksmiths and suppliers. As it can be seen in the following image, the database has three main section: one identifies the blacksmith, one identifies the supplier, and one gives information on each invoice in terms of id, date and cost.<br>

**My analysis**<br>
The purpose of my research was to analyze the invoice exchanges between blacksmiths and suppliers in order to identify trends and patterns. To achieve this, I first had to clean and prepare the data, which was a challenging task due to its large size and formatting issues. Once the data was ready, I analyzed the number of invoices and total amount produced in various regions and over time, as well as the strength and scale of the suppliers involved. I also mapped out the main center of activity by joining the data with a database of provincial coordinates. To gain a better understanding of the national and regional blacksmith market, I then proceeded to join the data with a database of all blacksmiths and calculated the percentage that we were monitoring. <br>

For this analysis, I primarily utilized PostgreSQL, but I also incorporated a range of other tools and platforms, including the BI tool Looker Studio, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and even Adobe Photoshop to create a more personalized look for my presentation. Additionally, I even employed ChatGPT to aid in certain aspects of the project.<br>

Displayed below is an example of the graphic elements included in the presentation, which illustrate the distribution of invoices produced in each region.

My future plans for this research include repeating these analyses on data from the previous two years and making predictions for the following year. I will then proceed to confront the prediction to the actual data of the following year, which I have already aquired, to test its accuracy and, if the results will be positive, I will incorporate that year as well to generate predictions for the year after. <br>
I also intend to acquire and analyze the content of the invoices to categorize the suppliers and gain further insights into the blacksmith-supplier relationship. <br>
